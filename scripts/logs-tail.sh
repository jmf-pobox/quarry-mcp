# Tail the most recent lines of the quarry daemon stderr log.
#
# The convenience companion to logs-errors.sh: a raw, unfiltered window on the
# freshest daemon stderr. Graceful in the two ways logs-errors.sh is, so the
# two behave symmetrically:
#   - the log absent is the normal pre-daemon state (report it, exit 0);
#   - a non-integer LOG_LINES falls back to 40 with a warning. Without this
#     guard an unguarded `tail -n <junk>` fails, and the old `|| echo` fallback
#     then LIED "no daemon stderr log" even when the log was present — the exact
#     misleading-fallback failure this guard closes (bug class 2).
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/logs-tail.sh
#   LOG_DIR=/path/to/logs LOG_LINES=80 scripts/logs-tail.sh
#
# Env overrides:
#   LOG_DIR    daemon log directory (default $HOME/.punt-labs/quarry/logs)
#   LOG_LINES  number of trailing lines to print (default 40)

# Same LOG_LINES sanitization as logs-errors.sh (second occurrence — below the
# rule-of-three extraction bar; each sibling stays self-contained rather than
# depend on a sourced lib whose path resolution is fragile under `set -u`).
