# Scan the quarry daemon log directory for error/failure signals.
#
# The daemon writes to ~/.punt-labs/quarry/logs (quarry-stderr.log, quarry.log,
# quarry-stdout.log). Nothing surfaces the errors accumulating there — `quarry
# doctor` does not read the log and no one greps it — so a broken watch/sync
# feature logged 100+ "Watch index failed" lines that sat unnoticed for weeks
# (alongside historical "LanceError(IO): Too many open files"). This target
# closes that blind spot: a first-class diagnostic that greps the live logs for
# known error signals, prints a per-signal summary count, then the most recent
# matching lines.
#
# It is a diagnostic, not a gate: it ALWAYS exits 0 (even when matches are
# found, and even when the log dir or files are absent). Wiring it into a
# quality gate would make routine runtime noise fail the build; keep it a
# standalone probe like `make report`.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/logs-errors.sh
#   LOG_DIR=/path/to/logs LOG_LINES=80 scripts/logs-errors.sh
#
# Env overrides:
#   LOG_DIR    daemon log directory (default $HOME/.punt-labs/quarry/logs)
#   LOG_LINES  most-recent matching lines to print (default 40)
