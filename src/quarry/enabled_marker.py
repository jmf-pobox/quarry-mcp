    """The presence marker for quarry being enabled in a repo.

    quarry is enabled in a repo when ``<repo>/.punt-labs/quarry/enabled``
    exists (tool-enable-disable.md § 2.7). ``enable`` writes it; ``disable``
    deletes it. This is a distinct signal from directory presence — the
    vendored guide persists after ``disable`` (the dormant state, § 2.9), so
    directory presence cannot mean "enabled." Both hook gates and ``punt
    audit`` read this one file. Per § 2.11 the marker is a commit point:
    :class:`quarry.enablement.Enablement` writes it only after the repo
    ``@.punt-labs/quarry/CLAUDE.md`` import is effective, so marker present ⇒
    import present. The reverse can differ mid-operation (import written, marker
    not) — the recoverable state a re-run reconciles.

    Access is symlink-safe against an *untrusted* repo: the marker is a
    :class:`quarry.safe_paths.SafeRepoPath`, so neither a symlinked leaf nor a
    symlinked ancestor can redirect the create/stat/unlink outside the repo.
