"""The one rule for deciding whether a file on disk needs re-embedding.

Two paths reach this question and they must answer it identically: the bulk
:class:`~quarry.sync_planner.SyncPlanner`, which buckets a whole collection
against the registry, and the watch loop's per-file
:class:`~quarry.ingestion.file_indexer.SingleFileIndexer`, which sees one
changed path at a time.  When only the bulk path knew the rule, an fs event on
byte-identical content — an editor's save-in-place, a branch switch restoring
the same bytes, a plain ``touch`` — re-embedded the whole document.

The decision carries the content hash it computed, so a caller that needs to
refresh the registry row does not hash the file a second time.
