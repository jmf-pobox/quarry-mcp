"""The scratch/temp exclusion predicate the watcher and indexer share (DES-045).

The always-on watch loop pegged the machine because the operator's registry
holds ``/private/tmp`` as a collection: the daemon watched the whole OS temp dir
(no ``.gitignore``, not a dot-dir) and OCR-stormed everything any process
dropped there.  This module is the single guard both the indexer
(:class:`~quarry.sync_discovery.FileDiscovery`) and the daemon watch/reconcile
path consult, so a temp/scratch tree is refused identically at scan time and at
watch time — an already-registered temp root becomes harmless on restart, not
just refused at register time.

Two rejections:

* A registered *root* that is a temp directory is refused outright —
  :meth:`ScratchGuard.refuses_root`.  "Temp" means an OS temp root
  (``/tmp``, ``/private/tmp``, ``/var/folders``…) *or* a repository's own
  gitignored ``.tmp`` scratch (``<repo>/.tmp`` — the ``$TMPDIR`` this workspace
  exports).

* Scratch/VCS/build/cache *subdirectories* below a real root
  (``node_modules``, ``htmlcov``, ``dist``, ``*.egg-info``…) are pruned by name
  — :meth:`ScratchGuard.skips_below_root`.

The repo-``.tmp`` case is anchored on the enclosing git repository, checking
*every* ancestor rather than a bare ``.tmp`` component anywhere in the path: a
root under ANY ancestor repo's ``.tmp`` is refused.  Checking every ancestor is
load-bearing — it is exactly what closes the nested-repo bypass, where a git
repo checked out under ``<outer>/.tmp`` would otherwise shadow the outer repo
and let a root still inside ``<outer>/.tmp`` be watched (a first-``.git``-wins
check has that hole).  A checkout or worktree living under a repo's own ``.tmp``
is therefore refused too; that over-refusal is the accepted, fail-closed
tradeoff and must NOT be "relaxed" to re-permit it — doing so reopens the
bypass.  Only a ``.tmp`` with no enclosing ``.git`` at all is permitted.
``<repo>/.tmp`` *below* a watched repo root is also pruned by the caller's
dot-prune and ``.gitignore`` rules; this guard adds the root-level refusal plus
the non-dot cache names those rules miss.
