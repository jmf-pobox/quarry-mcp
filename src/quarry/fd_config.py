"""The daemon's file-descriptor envelope: the two halves that size RLIMIT_NOFILE.

The envelope has two halves applied at two different moments. :class:`FdEnvelope`
raises the SOFT ``RLIMIT_NOFILE`` in-process at daemon start; :class:`FdServiceLimits`
bakes the service-manager SOFT/HARD ceiling into the launchd plist / systemd unit
BEFORE quarryd is spawned. The two are co-located because they are one design: the
service manager (the only actor that can raise a non-root process's HARD limit)
grants the ceiling, and ``FdEnvelope`` then lifts the soft off it at runtime. See
DES-046.

The daemon inherits launchd/systemd's soft ``RLIMIT_NOFILE`` (256 on macOS) and,
post-DES-045, holds one persistent LanceDB connection per roster database. Each
connection's reader-recycler bounds its own descriptors, but the aggregate across
a ~21-collection roster sits above a 256 limit sized for two connections, so the
daemon walks into ``EMFILE`` over long uptime. :class:`FdEnvelope` raises the soft
limit toward a configured target at daemon start — the sibling of
``ThreadConfig``'s CPU/thread envelope (DES-032), applied at the same seam before
the first ``lancedb.connect``. See DES-046.

The raise is fail-safe: a missing ``resource`` module, a raising ``getrlimit``,
or a raising ``setrlimit`` each degrade to a single logged line and the inherited
limit — the whole point is to survive, so a platform quirk must never crash the
daemon at start. A target above the hard limit is not a degrade: ``apply`` clamps
to the hard limit and successfully raises the soft limit to it. It never lowers
an already higher inherited soft limit, so an operator's ``LimitNOFILE=65536`` is
honored.

    launchd bootstrap inherits.  The hard ceiling is fixed and generous
    (``_SERVICE_FD_HARD``); the soft is the configured target (``Settings.fd_limit``,
    ``QUARRY_FD_LIMIT``-overridable), floored UNCONDITIONALLY at the safe default

    ceiling would silently re-admit a soft below ``DEFAULT_FD_LIMIT``, defeating it.

    ``QUARRY_FD_LIMIT`` is applied at INSTALL time, not at runtime: ``quarry install``
    bakes the soft limit into the plist ``SoftResourceLimits`` / systemd
