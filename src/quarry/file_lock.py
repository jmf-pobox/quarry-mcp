    """Hold an exclusive ``flock`` on a sibling lock file for one read-modify-write.

    A shared host-file mutation in tool-enable-disable.md § 2.4 — the
    ``CLAUDE.md`` import line — is a read-modify-write on a file other tools and
    invocations also touch. Atomic rename prevents a torn file but not a lost
    update: two parallel ``enable`` runs each read the old bytes, write their
    change, and rename, and the second silently clobbers the first. This lock
    serializes them.

    The lock file lives beside its target (``.CLAUDE.md.lock`` next to
    ``CLAUDE.md``) so it shares the directory the atomic rename needs anyway,
    and is created — never removed — so a waiter and a holder always ``flock``
    the same inode.

    **Reentrant within a process.** A nested acquisition of the same lock path
    (``Enablement`` holds the lock across its whole enable/disable sequence while
    ``ClaudeMdImport.register`` re-acquires it for the import edit) shares the one
    ``flock`` rather than opening a second descriptor. ``flock`` treats two
    independent opens of one file as independent holders even inside a single
    process, so a naive nested acquire would deadlock against the outer hold;
    counting the depth and locking once avoids that. Cross-process serialization
    is unaffected — another process blocks on the real ``flock`` until this
    process releases its outermost acquisition. (The depth registry is keyed by
    path for bookkeeping only; the intended nesting is sequential within one
    thread.)
