        The registry ``files`` rows are the delta's memory, but a keep-data disable

        so the delta alone cannot prune a file deleted while disabled. This
        reconciles the ACTUAL stored documents against disk; in steady state it
        matches the registry-derived set, so it only ever prunes genuine orphans.

        Gate on the stored absolute ``document_path``, NOT ``resolved /
        document_name``: ``document_name`` is only resolved-relative for
        sync-ingested docs — the pipeline default and captures store the basename,
        so reconstructing the path would mislocate a nested doc and prune it while
        live. Prune ONLY on definite absence (``FileNotFoundError`` /
        ``NotADirectoryError``); anything unprovable is KEPT (fail-safe) and
        retried next sync — one document's error never aborts the scan.

        A non-absolute ``document_path`` is unprovable and kept: a NULL Arrow value
        stringifies to ``"None"`` (not ``""``) through ``list_documents``, and a
        relative or blank path can't be resolved against a known root here, so
        ``Path.is_absolute`` is the gate — only an absolute path can be proven
        absent.
