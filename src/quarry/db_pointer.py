    Two things travel together and so belong in one class: the ``--db`` flag the
    current process was started with, and the default recorded in
    ``config.toml``. The override wins when set; otherwise the persisted default
    answers. Callers ask for the effective choice and do not resolve the
    precedence themselves.

    Recording the override matters beyond convenience: the client tier resolves
    the daemon's startup-db run directory from it, and ``serve.token`` lives in
    that directory. Client and daemon therefore agree on which database is in
    play only because both derive it from a matching ``--db``.

    Extracted from ``Settings``, which is a settings container and has no
    business owning a mutable process-scoped selection or a TOML file format.
