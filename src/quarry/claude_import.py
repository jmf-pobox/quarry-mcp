    """Reconcile a single ``@``-import line inside a user-owned ``CLAUDE.md``.

    The only mutation any tool may make to a ``CLAUDE.md`` is to add or remove
    one bare ``@``-import line (tool-enable-disable.md § 2.1). This class owns
    exactly that mutation for one host file and one import string:

    * **Serialized** — an exclusive ``flock`` on a sibling ``.lock`` file wraps
      the whole read-modify-write, so two concurrent ``enable`` runs cannot lose
      one update (§ 2.4). The atomic rename below prevents a torn file but not a
      lost update; the lock closes that gap, which the vox reference lacks.
    * **Idempotent, terminator-insensitive** — presence is decided by matching
      the canonical line against each host line *net of its terminator*, so a
      CRLF host does not carry a spurious ``\\r`` that defeats a byte-exact
      compare. ``register`` appends only if absent; ``prune`` removes every
      match (collapsing an accidental duplicate to zero).
    * **Top-level only** — a match inside a fenced (```` ``` ````/``~~~``) or an
      indented (tab or ≥4 spaces) code block is ignored by both the presence
      scan and the removal, because Claude Code resolves ``@``-imports only at
      the top level.
    * **Byte-preserving, host EOL** — every byte outside the single import line
      is identical before and after across LF, CRLF, and lone-CR; the appended
      line uses the host file's existing EOL. Delegated to :class:`AtomicFile`.
