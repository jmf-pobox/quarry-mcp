"""Daemon-health doctor checks: quarryd reachability, serve.token, and fd headroom.

Fail-closed loopback auth (:class:`quarry.client.ClientConfig`) tells operators to
"Run 'quarry doctor'" when ``serve.token`` is missing, unreadable, or empty. These
checks make that remediation real: they resolve the SAME run dir the client reads
(the active database's, per :meth:`quarry.db_pointer.DatabaseSelection.active`)
and diagnose a token/daemon outage instead of pointing at a dead end.

Descriptor headroom is likewise a property of the resident daemon — the only
long-lived process that accumulates LanceDB reader handles and can hit EMFILE —
so :meth:`DaemonDiagnostics.fd_headroom` reads the daemon's self-sampled ``fd``
field off ``/health`` rather than sampling the short-lived CLI, whose limit is
just the invoking shell's ``ulimit``.
