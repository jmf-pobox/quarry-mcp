"""Logging configuration for punt-quarry, and the level policy that governs it.

THE LEVEL POLICY, which binds every ``logger.*`` call in this codebase:

    INFO is one line per user-visible operation or coarser.
    Sub-operation detail is DEBUG.

A "user-visible operation" is something the operator asked for or would
recognise having happened: a document indexed, a collection swept, a database
optimized, the daemon started. Anything that fires more often than that —
per flush window, per request, per row — is DEBUG, however interesting it looked
when it was written.

The rule exists because the daemon spent its whole life logging nowhere: it
never configured logging at all, so INFO was discarded before reaching a
handler and nobody ever saw the volume. Switching the file on without a policy
would have replaced silence with a firehose, and a log too noisy to read fails
the same way a log that does not exist does. Two lines were demoted on the day
the file appeared — ``ChunkStore``'s per-flush insert and the search route's
per-request result count — and the next person tempted to log per-row should
read this instead of rediscovering it from a flooded file.
