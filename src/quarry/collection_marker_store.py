    Shares the :class:`~quarry.sync_registry.SyncRegistry` connection (the

    connection as the ``directories`` row change and commits with it — the marker
    write and the registry-row change are one transaction, atomic together. The
    caller owns the commit; these methods never commit.

    Two marker kinds: a RETAINED marker (keep-data disable, tagged with its origin
    directory so only that directory re-adopts) and a PENDING-PURGE marker (a
    non-keep deregister or a subsume eviction) — the closed set the orphan sweep
    is allowed to purge.  A collection never marked is structurally unreachable by
    the sweep, so captures, agent memories, and remember targets are safe.
