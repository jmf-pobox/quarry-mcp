"""Compute the disk-vs-registry sync plan for one collection, TOCTOU-resilient.

``SyncPlanner`` walks the files discovered under a registered directory and
compares each against the sync registry to bucket it into ingest / refresh /
delete / unchanged.  Every filesystem touch here is hardened against the races
the reconcile actually hits in production:

- a file present at ``discover()`` time but gone at its ``stat()`` turn is a
  DELETE event (routed into ``to_delete``), never a crash of the whole scan;
- a file present but unreadable is skipped and retried next scan (its indexed
  chunks are preserved — the fail-safe);
- a whole-collection delete is REFUSED when the root itself could not be
  resolved (fail-closed): an empty discovery from an unresolvable root must not
  read as "every registered file was deleted" and wipe the collection.

Extracting this from :mod:`quarry.sync` keeps the plan logic — the one place in
the reconcile that stats every file — in a single tested class with a natural
home (``_stat_or_skip``) for the per-file guard.
