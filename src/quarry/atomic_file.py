    """A text file rewritten without ever corrupting the user's content.

    Reads preserve bytes verbatim (``newline=""``), so a read/write round-trip
    keeps LF, CRLF, and lone-CR endings byte-identical. Each write lands
    atomically: a temp file in the target's own directory is flushed,
    ``fsync``-ed, and ``os.replace``-d over the target, so an interrupted write
    (SIGKILL, power loss) leaves the original untouched rather than truncated. A
    symlinked path is followed to its real file so the rename updates the file
    rather than clobbering the link. The replacement's mode defaults to the
    target's current mode (a brand-new file gets :data:`_NEW_FILE_MODE`), or a
    caller may force one via ``replace(..., mode=...)``.

    Ported from ``punt_vox.atomic_file`` (tool-enable-disable.md § 2.4 names the
    vox artifact as the reference for the atomic / symlink / byte-preserving /
    deterministic contract); the serialization lock the standard also mandates
    lives one layer up in :class:`quarry.claude_import.ClaudeMdImport`, which
    owns the read-modify-write this file only executes the write half of.
