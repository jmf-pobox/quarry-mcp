"""Rate-limit the per-database finalize (table optimize + full FTS rebuild).

The finalize is the heavy tail of every watch batch, and it is table-wide: it
compacts one database's chunks table and rebuilds the whole FTS index, every
collection's rows included.  Under sustained churn the debouncer would flush one
per window, so the daemon would compact continuously; this coalesces them.

Lives apart from :mod:`quarry.daemon.watch_submit` because it is a rate-limiting
policy with no knowledge of jobs, route keys, or the queue — its collaborator is
a thunk — while the submitter's job is turning watch events into IngestUnits.

    A finalize is the heavy tail of every watch batch, so under sustained churn
    the debouncer flushes one every window and the daemon compacts continuously.
    This coalesces them per database: the first request runs immediately, any
    request inside the interval arms a single trailing timer that runs one
    finalize when the interval elapses — so continuous churn costs one finalize
    per interval, and a finalize always lands after churn settles.  All state
    lives on the event loop, so no lock is needed.

    Granularity is the DATABASE, not the collection.  The trailing timer is armed
    on the first requesting collection's routing key, so it may run on that
    collection's FIFO before a *different* collection's in-flight file-index jobs
    complete.  The rebuild is table-wide, so it still reindexes every collection's
    already-committed chunks; only files a collection indexes *after* this
    finalize lag in FTS.  That lag self-heals within one bounded window: the
    periodic reconcile (``watch_safety_scan_s``, default 300 s) re-scans every
    registered collection with an IMMEDIATE (un-throttled) finalize.  The vector
    channel is never stale — files index immediately — so hybrid search degrades
    to vector-only for the lagging collection until the next finalize, never
    silently wrong.  With ``watch_safety_scan_s = 0`` the reconcile backstop is
    off and FTS lag clears only on that collection's next churn.
