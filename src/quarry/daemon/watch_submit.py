"""Turn watch batches and scans into IngestUnits on the DES-042 queue.

Extracted from :class:`~quarry.daemon.watch_loop.WatchLoop` so the loop owns
lifecycle + event marshaling while this owns the producer half: building
per-file / delete / bulk-scan / finalize jobs, submitting them on the
per-``(database, collection)`` queue, and re-arming a shed (503) live submit
through the debouncer with capped exponential backoff — a full queue is
transient and the file on disk is durable, so a change is delayed, never
dropped.  A shed *scan* or a failed job is recovered by the loop's periodic
disk-vs-registry reconcile, so no per-scan bookkeeping lives here.
