"""Linux-only: prune watchdog's recursive inotify watches per the shared ignore spec.

DES-045e (supersedes DES-045d's per-directory scheduling — operator-ratified).
Per-directory ``observer.schedule(..., recursive=False)`` (DES-045d) is
structurally wrong on Linux: watchdog gives every ``ObservedWatch`` its OWN
emitter, and each :class:`~watchdog.observers.inotify.InotifyEmitter`
constructs its own :class:`~watchdog.observers.inotify_c.Inotify`, which calls
the libc ``inotify_init()`` — one kernel INSTANCE plus ~2 threads and 3 fds
per directory. ``fs.inotify.max_user_instances`` defaults to 128 (per-user,
shared with IDEs/editors), so per-directory scheduling exhausts it at ~120
directories and silently degrades the whole tree to scan-only — the operator
will not raise this sysctl.

The fix returns to ONE recursive watch per root — one emitter, one kernel
instance, one thread-pair, regardless of tree size — and instead prunes the
much larger `fs.inotify.max_user_watches` budget (65,536, per-descriptor, no
per-user cap) by teaching the underlying ``Inotify`` wrapper (this module) to
skip ignored directories in both places it walks a directory tree:

* :meth:`Inotify._add_dir_watch` — the initial recursive walk run once from
  ``Inotify.__init__``.
* :meth:`Inotify._add_watch` — the single-directory primitive vanilla
  watchdog's ``read_events()`` auto-add path (and its nested
  ``_recursive_simulate`` helper, which backfills synthetic create events for
  a newly-created subtree's pre-existing contents) calls for every directory
  it discovers, including ones added later.

The chain that wires :class:`PrunedInotify` into watchdog's
``InotifyBuffer``/``InotifyEmitter``/``BaseObserver`` construction pipeline
lives in the sibling module :mod:`~quarry.daemon.inotify_prune_chain` — kept
separate so this module stays two classes: the pruning ALGORITHM, not the
plumbing that wires it in. ``test_inotify_prune.py``'s
``test_pins_the_watchdog_internals_this_module_subclasses`` fails loudly if a
future watchdog release renames or removes any of the methods either module
depends on, rather than the pruning silently going inert.

Platform scope: this module is imported ONLY on Linux
(:class:`~quarry.daemon.fs_watchdog.WatchdogSource` selects it by
``platform.system()``). macOS's FSEvents is one stream per root with NO
per-directory kernel cost, so it keeps watchdog's standard recursive
scheduling — pruning happens only at the post-debounce event filter
(:class:`~quarry.daemon.watch_submit.WatchSubmitter`), same as before DES-045d.

        raise ``KeyError`` and crash the observer thread instead of just
        being silently unwatched. The bookkeeping this leaves behind for a
        pruned path is deliberately never cleaned up (the kernel never emits
        an ``IN_IGNORED`` for a watch that was never really installed, which
        is the only signal vanilla watchdog cleans up on) -- a bounded,

        ``is_moved_to`` branch) reuses the shared ``_PRUNED_WD`` sentinel at
        the new path and can overwrite ``_path_for_wd[_PRUNED_WD]`` if two
        DIFFERENT pruned directories are each renamed -- harmless by
        construction: the real kernel never emits an event whose ``wd``
        field equals ``_PRUNED_WD`` (no ``inotify_add_watch`` call can ever
        return a negative descriptor), so that reverse-lookup slot is never
        read through a real event; see
