"""Rescan many collections while finalizing each database exactly once.

A finalize compacts one database's chunks table and rebuilds its whole FTS
index — every collection's rows, in one pass.  Submitting one per collection
therefore repeats identical table-wide work: six registered collections meant
six back-to-back optimize+rebuild pairs on every safety scan, which is what the
daemon's log showed.  The right granularity is the DATABASE, which is what
:class:`~quarry.daemon.finalize_throttle.FinalizeThrottle` already assumes for
the churn path; this applies it to the sweeps.

The finalize stays IMMEDIATE rather than throttled.  Every sweep is one-shot or
the backstop — the initial watch scan, an explicit ``quarry sync``, the periodic
reconcile whose finalize is the FTS self-heal — so it must always run, never
coalesce away.  Deduplication and rate-limiting are different mechanisms with
different consequences: one drops repeated work, the other defers needed work.
