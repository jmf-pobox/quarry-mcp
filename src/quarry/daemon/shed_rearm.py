"""Re-arm filesystem events the ingest queue shed, with exponential backoff.

A full queue (503) is transient and the file on disk is durable, so a shed
change is delayed and never dropped: the events go back through the debouncer
after a delay that doubles per consecutive failure for the same routing key,
capped so a persistently full queue still retries at a steady rate.

Separated from :class:`~quarry.daemon.watch_submit.WatchSubmitter` because the
two share no state.  Submitting reads the roster, the context, and the finalize
throttle; re-arming owns the per-key delay, the pending timer handles, and the
debouncer to feed them back into — a disjoint set, which is the definition of a
second responsibility living in one class.
