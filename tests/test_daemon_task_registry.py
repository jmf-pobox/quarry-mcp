"""Ref-lifecycle invariants for the daemon's background-task registry.

The daemon runs for days, so a strong ref that never leaves ``_refs`` is a slow
memory leak. These tests pin the invariant that ``track`` retains a task while
it runs and drops the ref once the task reaches a terminal state — including
the boundary case of a task that is *already done* when ``track`` is called.
