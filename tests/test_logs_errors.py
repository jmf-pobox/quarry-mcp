"""Tests for the daemon-log diagnostics ``scripts/logs-errors.sh`` and
``scripts/logs-tail.sh``.

The quarry daemon appends to ``~/.punt-labs/quarry/logs`` (quarry-stderr.log,
quarry.log, quarry-stdout.log). Nothing surfaced the errors accruing there —
``quarry doctor`` does not read the log and no one greps it — so a broken
watch/sync feature logged 100+ ``Watch index failed`` lines that sat unnoticed
for weeks. ``make logs-errors`` (this script) closes that blind spot.

Per CLAUDE.md Class 5 / testing rule 6, shell logic gets a mock/fixture test,
not just shellcheck (shellcheck coverage for every ``scripts/*.sh`` lives in
``test_build_scripts.py``). These drive the scripts against a synthetic fixture
log dir and assert they (a) report the known errors, (b) always exit 0 — a
diagnostic, not a gate — (c) handle a missing or empty log dir gracefully, and
(d) never report a false clean when a log is unreadable (bug class 2).
