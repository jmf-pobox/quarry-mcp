"""Hermetic tests for FinalizeThrottle — per-database finalize rate-limiting.

Driven on a real event loop with a tiny interval and a callable that records
calls and reports admission, so the run-now / coalesce-into-trailing /
per-database-independence / shed-does-not-stamp behaviours are asserted without
the queue, watchdog, or the filesystem.
