One fake, installed at the factory by an autouse fixture, replaces the roughly
forty independent ``patch("...get_embedding_backend", ...)`` context managers
that each named a single import site.  Any test reaching the model through a
site none of those patches happened to name would silently load 410 MB and
still pass; the fixture closes that by construction, and this class is what it
installs.

    meaningless.  Seeding from a checksum of the text keeps the mapping stable
