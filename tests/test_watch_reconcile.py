"""Tests for WatchReconciler's durable, closed-set orphan sweep.

The sweep purges ONLY collections the registry explicitly marked for purge
(``pending_purge_collections``, marked on a non-keep-data deregister or a subsume
eviction) that still hold chunks -- ``(pending & chunk_cols) - registered -
retained``.  The non-negotiable invariant: a registered, operator-kept
(keep-data), or never-marked collection (captures, memories, remember targets)
is NEVER swept.  These tests exercise a real LanceDB + registry so the sweep's
marked-set computation is genuine, not mocked.
