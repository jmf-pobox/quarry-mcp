Quantum computing harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics to process information in fundamentally different ways than classical computers. While classical bits exist in states of either 0 or 1, quantum bits (qubits) can exist in superposition, representing both states simultaneously. This property allows quantum computers to explore multiple computational paths in parallel, offering exponential speedups for certain classes of problems.

Superposition and entanglement are the two pillars of quantum computation. When qubits become entangled, measuring the state of one qubit instantaneously determines the state of its partner, regardless of the physical distance between them. Quantum algorithms such as Shor's algorithm for integer factorization and Grover's algorithm for unstructured search exploit these phenomena to achieve computational advantages that are provably impossible for classical machines.

Practical applications of quantum computing span cryptography, drug discovery, materials science, and optimization problems. Quantum computers could break widely used encryption schemes like RSA by efficiently factoring large prime numbers. In chemistry, they can simulate molecular interactions at the quantum level, accelerating the design of new pharmaceuticals and catalysts. Companies like IBM, Google, and various startups are racing to build fault-tolerant quantum processors with enough qubits to achieve quantum advantage on commercially relevant problems.
