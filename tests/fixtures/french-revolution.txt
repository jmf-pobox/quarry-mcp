The French Revolution, which began in 1789, was driven by widespread discontent with the monarchy, an inequitable tax system, and severe food shortages. The Third Estate, comprising commoners who bore the heaviest tax burden, demanded political representation proportional to their numbers. Enlightenment ideas about liberty, equality, and popular sovereignty provided the intellectual framework for challenging the ancien regime.

The storming of the Bastille on July 14, 1789, marked a turning point as Parisian citizens seized the fortress-prison, symbolizing the overthrow of royal authority. The National Assembly abolished feudal privileges and issued the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. King Louis XVI was eventually tried for treason and executed by guillotine in January 1793, plunging France into the radical phase known as the Reign of Terror.

The revolution's aftermath reshaped European politics and society. Napoleon Bonaparte rose to power in the chaos following the Directory, eventually crowning himself Emperor in 1804. The revolution established principles of citizenship, constitutional government, and secular law that influenced democratic movements worldwide. Its legacy includes the metric system, the Napoleonic Code, and the modern concept of the nation-state.
